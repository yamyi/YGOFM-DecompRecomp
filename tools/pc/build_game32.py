"""Compile and link the resident game C as a 32-bit Linux or Windows executable,
or as the Android app's libgame.so (--target android-<abi>).

Bring-up driver for the fixed-address memory model (src/pc/guest/image.h):
  * every game unit is compiled with the host GCC as ILP32;
  * data symbols the units leave undefined or tentative are pinned to their
    retail addresses, read from the matching build's ELF;
  * undefined functions get generated stubs that name themselves and exit,
    unless a native source under src/pc already defines them.
The retail addresses come from config/pc/guest_addresses.txt, which this
script writes from the matching build's ELFs (make match match-overlays)
whenever they are present, so a checkout without the MIPS toolchain builds too.

On Windows the toolchain is llvm-mingw (i686-w64-mingw32-clang, lld and the
llvm binutils) and the libraries come from tools/pc/build_win32_deps.py. PE
differs from ELF in ways the link below works around: C symbols carry a
leading underscore; sections cannot be placed at chosen addresses, so the
fixed game sections (save states across rebuilds) are not available; the
section renames edit the COFF headers directly (rename_coff_sections) and
__start_/__stop_ come from grouped marker sections; overrides win by link order instead of weakened symbols.

--target windows-x64 is the native 64-bit Windows build (notes/pc-build.md,
"64-bit Windows"): x86_64-w64-mingw32-clang, clang 21 or later, the game's
stored pointers 4 bytes wide through G32 (src/port_ptr.h), and the image
linked at 0x40000000 without ASLR so that host code stays below 4 GB and
within reach of the pinned guest addresses. Its default build directory is
tmp/pc/win64.

On Android (--target android-arm64-v8a: 64-bit ARM, with G32 as windows-x64;
android-x86 builds for development and is not packaged) the
toolchain is the NDK's clang and LLVM tools, and the libraries come from
tools/pc/build_android_deps.py. The game is a position-independent shared
object, libgame.so, linked at a fixed base; libmain.so, which SDL's Java shell
loads and whose SDL_main it runs, is a loader that puts the game at that base
(src/pc/platform/android_loader.c) and starts the port's main through
src/pc/platform/android.c. It is ELF, so the Linux steps apply, except that
sections cannot be placed at chosen addresses (as on Windows). The APK is packaged beside it (<build>/memories-<abi>.apk, by
package_android.py) with the SDK's build tools; notes/pc-build.md, "Android"."""

    A mod is its manifest and whatever it ships; if it has C, that becomes
    one object file for this game's target (tools/pc/build_mod.py), which
    the game's own loader links in when the mod is applied
    (src/pc/mods/object_loader.c). One i386 object serves both 32-bit
    systems, so the Linux and the Windows game can carry the same file; the
    64-bit Windows game carries the x86_64-windows one. build_mod.py keeps
    it in tmp/pc/mod-build/<mod>-<key>, the key a digest of the compiler,
    the flags and the preprocessed sources: every checkout shares tmp (the
    worktrees link it), and one reuses an object only when it would build
    the same one. It is copied
    beside this game when the copy there differs, and checked against this
    game's exports either way.

    The SDK goes beside the game too, so a release carries what a mod author
    builds against: modapi.h and the game's headers under sdk/include, the C
    library a mod may use under sdk/include/libc, build_mod.py and the texture
    pack tools under sdk/tools, the example mods under sdk/examples/mods and
