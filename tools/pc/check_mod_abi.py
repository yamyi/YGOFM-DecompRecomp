"""Check that the mods made for earlier releases still work with this build.

A code mod is an object file built against one release's SDK (sdk/include,
sdk/exports.txt) and loaded by later ones (notes/modding.md), so what it was
compiled against has to stay as it was:

  exports    every name a baseline release lent a mod is still lent
  functions  an exported function or variable the SDK declares keeps its type
  records    a structure one of those reaches, by value or by pointer, keeps
             its size, field offsets and field types (growing one is a break
             too: a mod may allocate it, or hand it to the game)
  enums      an enumerator keeps its value; a removed one breaks a mod's
             source, and every later one moves with it

Each header of both SDKs is compiled on its own, as build_mod.py compiles a
mod (i386, -ffreestanding -nostdinc, the SDK's C library), and clang's AST
and record layouts are compared. That part needs no disc and runs in CI after
the release package is built.

With --run it also loads the baseline release's own mods, and its SDK's
examples built by its own build_mod.py, into this build's executable (the
disc is needed), and plays each smoke case that turns mods on
(tests/pc/smoke) with the baseline's copies of those mods and with this
build's: every code mod must load, and the frames must be the same.

Each release is held to the target its mods were built for (mod_compat.txt:
`baseline TAG [TARGET]`, i386 when no target is named). The 64-bit Windows
build (build_game32.py --target windows-x64) loads x86_64-windows objects:
its SDK (exports.x86_64-windows.txt, the headers compiled as build_mod.py
--target x86_64-windows compiles them) is compared with the x86_64-windows
baselines, of which there are none until a release ships 64-bit mods; and
--run plays every i386 baseline's mods there, checking that each 32-bit code
mod is refused by name ("needs a 64-bit build of this mod", the Mods
window's note) and never loaded, and that the data mods load as on 32-bit.

The releases checked, and the differences reviewed and accepted, are in
tools/pc/mod_compat.txt, with the sha256 GitHub lists for each release's
package (an x86_64-windows baseline's is its windows-x64 one). A release is
downloaded once into tmp/pc/mod-compat, and unpacked only if its package is
the one pinned there; the package is kept beside the
folder and checked again each time the folder is used, and a folder without
its package is downloaded again rather than trusted.
Each --run plays in a folder of its own beside it, tmp/pc/mod-compat/run/
TAG-XXXXXXXX, kept when the run found a difference not accepted in
mod_compat.txt (or stopped) and removed otherwise: worktrees
share tmp/ (a junction to the main checkout's), so two checks running at once
in two of them took each other's frames and folders when they shared one."""
