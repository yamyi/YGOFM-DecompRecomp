"""Which game a mod needs: its "min_api", from what its mod.json uses.

The port refuses a mod whose "min_api" is past its own mod API (manager.c
Mods_Compatible: "needs a newer game: mod API N, this one has M"), data mods
too. A game older than a key or value a mod uses would instead leave that
part out, with at most an "unknown key" note, and play the rest: a
half-working mod. So the editor writes, on save, the lowest API that has
every feature the mod uses, never lowering a "min_api" the author set
higher. notes/modding.md ("Which game a mod needs") lists the same features.

HOST_API is src/pc/mods/mod_types.h's MEMORIES_MOD_API. The packaged editor
has no source tree to read it from, so it is a constant here and
tests/test_compat.py holds it to that header.
