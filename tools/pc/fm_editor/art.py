"""Card art: the pictures the disc holds for each card, and a mod's own.

A card's art record is seven sectors of WA_MRG.MRG from sector 722
(func_800289BC; src/pc/cards/art.h has the layout): the 102x96 picture at
one byte a pixel through its 256-entry palette (+0x2640), the 96x14 name
plate at four bits a pixel (+0x2840, inks 0 clear, 1 darkest to 7
faintest, drawn subtractively over the card's gold), and the thumbnail
block. The duel reads the 40x32 thumbnail from the card's own sector n-1
(64-entry palette at +0x500): the hand and the field draw it.

A mod replaces them two ways, and the editor uses one per card:

* a retail card's picture and thumbnail: a texture pack (mod.json
  "textures", notes/modding.md), an entry per image keyed by where the words
  are on the disc, exactly as tools/pc/extract_images.py and
  hd_assets_pack.py address them. A pack image may be larger than the
  texture: Internal 2x and 4x draw it at its own resolution.
* a card the mod adds (a copy) has the disc offsets of its base, so a pack
  cannot tell them apart: its picture and thumbnail are the entry's "art"
  and "thumbnail" PNGs (cards.c), made into 102x96 and 40x32 at 255 and 63
  colours when the game starts; one bigger than that is also drawn at its
  own resolution at Internal 2x and 4x, as a pack's is.
* the name plate of any card: the entry's "title" PNG (a retail card gets a
  "replace" entry for it).

A retail card whose "replace" entry has "art" gets that drawn over the
record and reported written, which hides a pack's picture of it: importing
a picture for a retail card moves it to the pack.
