"""mod.json out of a Project (only what differs from retail), and back.

The schema is the one the port reads (notes/modding.md, notes/more-cards.md,
notes/gameplay-tables.md; src/pc/mods/mods.c, src/pc/cards/cards.c and
tables.c, starter.c and packs.c): "cards" (replace and copy), "fusions",
"equips", "rituals", "drops", "decks", "starter", "packs" and "pack_shop".
Every other top-level key a mod
has (data, text, textures, audio, library, requires..., and "duelists") is
kept as it was written.

The duelists the editor knows are the forty the disc lays out, because it
reads the game's own files; a mod's own duelists (notes/more-duelists.md) are
made at run time, from whichever mods are applied. So a "decks" or "drops"
entry naming one of those, or either table given as the name of a file, is
kept as it was written rather than resolved -- and the four roster folders
beside the manifest are copied with the rest of the mod's files (save_mod).
