"""Build a code mod: every .c in its directory, merged into one object per
target (--target, default all three):

  i386            <library>.o, the 32-bit games' (Linux and Windows)
  x86_64-windows  <library>.x86_64-windows.o, the 64-bit Windows game's
  aarch64         <library>.aarch64.o, the arm64 (Android) game's, which it
                  does not load yet: built so that a mod's tooling is ready

("library": "x" in mod.json; "x.o" names the same three. A "libraries"
object, {"x86_64-windows": "file.o", ...}, names a target's file outright,
as the game reads it: read_manifest in src/pc/mods/mods.c.)

The i386 object runs on both the Linux and the Windows game, which load it
with their own loader (src/pc/mods/object_loader.c), so a mod is built once,
on either system, with the same result. That only holds because the flags
below close every gap between the two 32-bit ABIs
(notes/portable-mods-plan.md):

  -fno-pic -fno-common            plain relocations only; no GOT, no COMMON
  -fno-stack-protector            the canary lives in Linux thread storage
  -march=i686 -mno-sse            x87 floating point, no SSE alignment needs
  -mstackrealign                  every function aligns its own stack to 16:
                                  Windows only promises 4 on the way in, and
                                  the Linux game (SSE2) needs 16 on the way
                                  out, or it faults on the first movaps
  -fstack-clash-protection        touches each stack page on the way down,
                                  as Windows' guard page requires
  -ffreestanding -nostdinc        no system C library: the SDK's headers
                                  (src/pc/mods/sdk) declare what the game lends
  -mretpoline-external-thunk      (clang; GCC: -mindirect-branch=thunk-extern
                                  -mindirect-branch-register) indirect calls go
                                  through the game's __x86_indirect_thunk_*,
                                  so a call through a guest function pointer
                                  works without DEP, as in the game's own code

The compiler is clang (on Windows, llvm-mingw's, targeting i386 Linux ELF),
else gcc -m32. MEMORIES_MOD_CC names another. The game's headers come from
src/ (in this repository) or from the sdk/include the game ships beside it,
where this script is sdk/tools/build_mod.py.

The 64-bit targets need clang (the same one builds all three) and differ:

  x86_64-windows  the Windows x64 calling convention in an ELF64 object
                  (--target=x86_64-w64-windows-gnu-elf: one loader reads
                  every target's objects); -mno-ms-bitfields, the game's
                  layouts
  aarch64         AAPCS64 as the Android game (aarch64-linux-android24 and
                  its flags), through tools/pc/ptr32_stores.py as every game
                  unit is (LLVM's AArch64 back end mis-sizes stores through a
                  4-byte pointer)
  both            -fms-extensions: the game's stored pointers stay 4 bytes
                  (G32, src/port_ptr.h); src/pc/mods/prelude64.h first, which
                  also declares the guest tables mods reach most, so a mod
                  that declares one itself without G32 does not compile; the
                  game's headers as system headers, and the mod's own pointer
                  and integer mix-ups (a pointer cast to a 32-bit int, a
                  pointer of another type) as errors, since on 64 bits they
                  lose half an address. A `.memories.abi` section names the
                  target, which the loader checks: x86-64 objects of the
                  Linux and of the Windows ABI look alike.

The names the mod leaves undefined are checked against what the game
provides: in the repository, each game build (--game, default both); beside
a game, the list its SDK was shipped with. A mod that would load on one
system and not the other fails here rather than in the game.

Objects are kept in tmp/pc/mod-build/<mod>-<key>, where the key is a digest
of everything that goes into the object: the compiler and linker (their
files), the flags, the include-path environment variables (ENVIRONMENT),
this script, and each source as the preprocessor sees
it, so with every header it includes (inputs_key). tmp is shared by every
checkout of the repository (the worktrees link it), and an object is reused
only where its inputs are the same, never because it is newer. A memo in
tmp/pc/mod-build/.memo finds the key again without the preprocessor while
none of the files it read has changed."""
