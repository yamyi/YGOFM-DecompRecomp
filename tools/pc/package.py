"""Build the game for sharing: archives for Windows (32-bit and 64-bit) and Linux.

    python3 tools/pc/package.py                # all three, into dist/
    python3 tools/pc/package.py windows-x64    # the 64-bit Windows one only

Packing all three where the 64-bit Windows game cannot be built (no
x86_64-w64-mingw32-clang 21 or later) skips that one with a message and
packs the other two; asking for windows-x64 by name stops there instead.

Each archive is a folder a player unpacks and runs: the executable, the mods
the release ships (the same object files for both systems), the mod SDK,
the official European languages' text (languages/, Game > Language), the
symbol table save states and crash reports use, an empty "game" folder for
the player's own disc image, and README.txt (tools/pc/release). Nothing else
from the game's discs is included.

The Linux executable is built against Debian 11's libraries
(tools/pc/build_linux_sysroot.py), as every Linux build is, so it runs on
other people's Linux. Every build is smoke tested before it is packed.

The 64-bit Windows archive (-windows-x64.zip, notes/pc-build.md "64-bit
Windows") unpacks to a folder of its own (yfm-redecomp-<version>-x64). Its
mods are the same, with each code mod's x86_64-windows object in place of
the 32-bit one, its SDK the same (build_mod.py builds every target), and
its README's Mods section says that a code mod needs a 64-bit build
there.

    python3 tools/pc/package.py android-arm64  # the Android app, signed

android-arm64 is not among the default ones (it needs the Android SDK, the
NDK and a JDK; notes/pc-build.md, "Android"). Its package is the APK itself,
dist/yfm-redecomp-<version>-android-arm64.apk, and it is made only with the
release key: MEMORIES_ANDROID_KEYSTORE and its password must be set
(tools/pc/package_android.py, notes/pc-release.md "Android signing"), and an
APK signed with the debug key is never put in dist/. A build_game32.py
--target android-arm64-v8a build without them is the debug-signed APK for
testing, in its build folder."""
