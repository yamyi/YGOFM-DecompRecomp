/* The internal resolution drawn by OpenGL: see gl_picture.h.
 *
 * Recording. The software GPU hands over every GP0 batch and every transfer
 * made outside one (soft_gpu.h, SoftGpuRecorder), in order, and they are
 * appended to an arena as they come. A transfer can arrive from the
 * interrupt tick in the middle of a batch being appended, so an append
 * reserves its words with an atomic add and nothing ever moves the arena;
 * when it is full the frame is replayed from VRAM instead (a resync).
 *
 * Replay, at present, with the clock held. VRAM is a 16-bit integer texture
 * that the fragment shader decodes (4, 8 and 16 bits per texel through the
 * palette) exactly as the software GPU samples it; the picture is a color
 * texture on a framebuffer, scale x scale pixels per word. Loads, fills and
 * copies are applied to both in order; primitives are drawn into the
 * picture only, and after the replay VRAM as the software GPU left it is
 * uploaded whole, so the next frame's textures are what the console's
 * would be (what a primitive draws is not sampled by a later primitive of
 * the same frame: that would be render-to-texture, which the game does
 * only through a read-back and a load, and where it matters the game code
 * says so: SoftGpu_Capture, below). Blending: a fragment's color comes out pre-multiplied and its alpha
 * is the destination's factor, so opaque pixels and modes 0, 1 and 3 share
 * one draw; mode 2 (subtractive) draws its opaque texels first and then
 * its semi-transparent ones with a subtracting equation. No dithering, and
 * no mask checks: the game only ever sets the mask bit. The rules are the
 * software picture pass's (soft_gpu.c), which is this pass's oracle
 * (MEMORIES_GL_PICTURE=0 selects it on the same build). */
