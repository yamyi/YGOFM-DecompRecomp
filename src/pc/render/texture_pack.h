/* A texture pack: a directory of PNGs named by where the images come from
 * on the disc, as tools/pc/extract_images.py writes them, with its
 * manifest.json. When an upload tags VRAM words with their disc offsets
 * (texture_dump.c), the words an image covers get its pixels in the shadow,
 * and a primitive whose palette is the one the image was extracted through
 * samples the shadow instead of VRAM. A pack image may be any size: it is
 * resampled to the texture's own size for the console's resolution, and
 * sampled at its own for an internal resolution above it. Packs add up; a
 * mod names its pack with "textures" in its manifest (src/pc/mods). `rank`
 * is the pack's place in the mods' load order: where two packs read the
 * same words the same way, the higher rank's image is the one drawn.
 * Returns the number of images indexed (0 when every one is switched off,
 * below), -1 when the pack cannot be used, and writes into `problems` (may be
 * NULL) a line on the entries that were left out and why, for the Mods
 * window: a file missing or not a PNG, outside the pack, measures out of
 * range. An entry with a "setting" is one part of the pack the owning mod
 * switches with that setting: `part` says 1 while it is on, 0 while off,
 * -1 when the mod declares no such setting (a problem; the entry is used).
 * `part` may be NULL. */
