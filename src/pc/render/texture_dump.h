 * is the rectangle of texels one textured primitive covers, decoded through
 * its palette; the hash covers the texel indices (or 16-bit colors) and the
 * palette entries, so the same sprite drawn with another palette is another
 * image, and the same one drawn again is the same file. The directory also
 * gets textures.txt, one line per image: hash, size, depth, page and palette
 * coordinates. A replacement pack names its files by the same hash. */

 * opaque black, which a PS1 word can only be with its semi-transparency
 * bit, is TEXTURE_SHADOW_BLACK: the renderer draws it as 0x8000 where the
 * game's word has that bit and as the darkest red, 0x0001, where it has
 * not (0x0000 would be transparent). The pack (texture_pack.c, which reads the PNGs) fills
 * cells through `paint`, called after an upload has tagged its words; the
 * cells follow the words through moves and clears. `prepare` runs once per
 * textured primitive, before it samples, with one texel it will sample,
 * and says whether this primitive may take from the shadow (1: its palette
 * is the one the shadow's image was painted for) or only from the scaled
 * picture's sampler (2: the words have an image for its palette too, but
