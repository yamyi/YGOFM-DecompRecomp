/* Audio replacement: a mod's "audio" object (notes/modding.md, "Audio")
 * swaps the game's songs, XA streams and sound effects for WAV or Ogg
 * Vorbis files, with no code.
 *
 * The files are decoded when the mod is applied, to 44.1 kHz s16 stereo in
 * memory. Three kinds of caller meet here, and none of them waits on
 * another:
 *
 *  - the mod system (main thread): AudioReplace_Load/Unload. The id tables
 *    change only with the game clock held off (SIGALRM blocked) and the
 *    mixer held out of the channels, so a clip is never freed while
 *    something reads it;
 *  - the sound driver (game thread, much of it on the VBlank interrupt):
 *    the Music/Xa/Sfx calls below. They read the tables, post requests into
 *    fixed channel slots and log with Log_Signal; nothing allocates, locks
 *    or prints;
 *  - the mixer (audio thread, inside Spu_Mix): MixBegin/MixFrame/MixEnd.
 *    It takes posted requests through a sequence word per slot and mixes.
 *
 * The game's own sound keeps running underneath: a replaced song's
 * sequence still plays (its voices are muted in the mix), a replaced XA
 * clip is still read at the drive's pace (its decoded sectors are dropped),
 * so everything the game times on them is unchanged. */
