/* A mod's .zip put into the mods folder (notes/mods-window.md, "Import
 * mod..."): the Android Mods panel's Import button, which has no folder to
 * copy a mod into by hand. Platform-independent, so the tests run it on a
 * desktop; nothing on a desktop calls it.
 *
 * Mods_ImportOpen reads the .zip's central directory and checks every
 * entry before anything is written: no name that leaves the folder (an
 * absolute path, a drive letter, a ".." or "." part; backslashes count as
 * slashes), no symbolic link or other special file, no encryption, only
 * stored and deflated entries, at most MODS_IMPORT_ENTRIES of them and
 * MODS_IMPORT_BYTES once unpacked. The mods are the folders holding a
 * mod.json: the .zip's root itself (the folder is then named by the
 * manifest's id), the folders at its top, or the folders one wrapper folder
 * down; a mod.json inside a mod is that mod's file. __MACOSX/ is left out.
 *
 * Mods_ImportInstall unpacks them into a new hidden folder of the mods
 * folder (".import-XXXXXX", which the mod scan skips), checking each
 * entry's size and CRC, and then renames each mod into place, after moving
 * the folder it replaces (ModsImportMod.replace) aside. Any failure puts
 * back what it moved and removes the hidden folder: nothing is written
 * outside the mods folder, and nothing half unpacked is left in it. An old
 * folder that cannot be put back is kept in ".recovered-XXXXXX" (named in
 * the reason), never removed. Names are at most 32 folders deep; two mods
 * with one folder or one id are refused. */
