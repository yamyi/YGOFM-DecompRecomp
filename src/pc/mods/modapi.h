/* The interface a code mod is built against. A mod is a directory with a
 * mod.json in it, either beside the executable (the ones the release ships)
 * or in the player's own mods directory (paths.h); see notes/modding.md.
 *
 * A mod that only replaces or patches data on the disc needs no code at all:
 * its manifest names the files. A mod with code is one object file, the same
 * for every system (tools/pc/build_mod.py builds it), and defines one symbol,
 *
 *     int MemoriesModInit(const MemoriesModHost *host, MemoriesMod *mod);
 *
 * which fills `mod` in and returns nonzero to accept the load. It is called
 * when the mod is applied, never before, and the code then stays in the
 * process until the game exits.
 *
 * What the host offers here is what a mod can reach safely. There is no
 * network call and no way to name a file outside the mod's own directories:
 * paths are relative, and "..", absolute paths and drive letters are
 * refused. A code mod is still native code linked into the game -- it can
 * reach the whole game image the same way the port's own code does, which is
 * the point of it -- so install mods you trust, as you would any plugin.
 *
 * In a mod, <stdio.h> is the SDK's (src/pc/mods/sdk): FILE is opaque there.

 * version can check host->api before it calls an entry the host may not
