/* The loader for code mods: one ELF relocatable object (`.o`) per target
 * (notes/modding.md). The 32-bit games, Linux and Windows, read the same
 * 32-bit x86 object: both are 32-bit x86 with the same calling convention,
 * so the machine code in a mod runs on either; only the container differs,
 * and this reads the one container on both. The 64-bit Windows game reads
 * an x86-64 object of the Windows ABI in the same container (ELF64), whose
 * `.memories.abi` section names it (build_mod.py --target x86_64-windows).
 *
 * Loading lays the object's allocated sections out in fresh memory, binds
 * each name it leaves undefined through `resolve` (the game's export table
 * and the host's C library, exports.h), applies its relocations, and then
 * makes the code executable and nothing else. The file is untrusted input:
 * anything malformed, and anything this loader does not do, fails with a
 * message and leaves nothing behind. What it does not do, on purpose:
 * position-independent code (a GOT), thread-local storage, COMMON symbols,
 * and constructors. tools/pc/build_mod.py builds objects without any of
 * them. */

/* The target this game loads mods for: build_mod.py's name for it, the
 * `.memories.abi` tag a 64-bit object carries, and the middle of its file
 * name (`<library>.<target>.o`; the 32-bit games' is `<library>.o`). The
 * macOS ARM64 game links a dylib instead (build_mod.py --target macos,
 * ObjectLoader_LoadPath, `<library>.dylib`): its "libraries" key is "macos",
 * so an Android object named under "aarch64" is never handed to it. */
