/* The deck a new game starts with, as mods write it down
 * (notes/starter-deck.md).
 *
 * A mod's manifest may carry "starter": one deck, or a list of them, each
 * forty cards written down by their copies. When any applied mod offers one,
 * NameEntry_BuildStarterDeck deals a deck from this list in place of the
 * disc's seven weighted pools; the decks every applied mod offers add up, and
 * one of them is picked at random for each new game.
 *
 * Writing the deck down rather than weighting a pool is what lets a starting
 * deck hold a card the disc has not got: the disc's pools are 722 weights of
 * a fixed width, and its generator reads only the first 720 of them
 * (STARTER_DECK_WEIGHT_SCAN_COUNT), so no weight can name a card a mod added.
 * A written deck names cards by id, so a mod's own are dealt like any other.
 *
 * Nothing here runs when no mod offers a deck: the disc's pools are read as
 * they always were, and draw the random numbers they always drew. */
