/* The deck a new game starts with, as mods write it down (starter.h,
 * notes/starter-deck.md).
 *
 * Each applied mod's "starter" is read into the decks here, once, in the
 * order the mods load, and they add up: a mod adds its decks to whatever the
 * mods before it offered rather than replacing them. NameEntry_BuildStarterDeck
 * asks for one before it reads the disc's pools, and takes the disc's path
 * when no mod offers any.
 *
 * A deck is forty cards written down by their copies, as an opponent's fixed
 * deck is (tables.c). The counts are the deck, so the three-copy limit of a
 * dealt deck does not apply here either: the author wrote down every copy.
 * What a player would not be able to rebuild in Build Deck afterwards is
 * said in the Mods window, and the deck is dealt as written. */
