/**
 * Starts the game again in a new process: Platform_RestartGame on Android
 * (src/pc/platform/android.c), where a restart cannot re-execute the
 * program as it does on a desktop.
 *
 * The game's process maps its guest memory at fixed addresses and keeps the
 * game library loaded, so the new game needs a new process: this activity
 * runs in a process of its own (":restart", tools/pc/package_android.py),
 * started by the game while it is in the foreground. It ends the game's
 * process (the "pid" extra), waits for it to be gone (SDLActivity is
 * singleInstance: a live one would only be brought back), launches the
 * game as the launcher does, and ends its own process. Nothing is shown.
 *
 * Gone is both signals at once: no /proc entry and no longer in the
 * system's list of this app's processes, which is the one the launch is
 * matched against and can trail the process's own end. A device that shows
 * neither (a /proc that hides it) gets a fixed half second instead. At most
 * five seconds: then the launch goes out anyway.
