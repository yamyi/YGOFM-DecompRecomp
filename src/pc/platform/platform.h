 *    game clock and monotonic real time (time-based game services use
 *    game_us, music sequencing uses real_us so the score keeps its tempo);
 *    `vblank` fires at 59.94 Hz of game time. Handlers must be
 *    async-signal-safe. The speed setting scales game time: percent of real
 *    time, 0 paused, -1 uncapped (a VBlank whenever the game waits for one).
 * 2. Presentation. Independently of the game clock, at most one game frame
 *    per present period reaches the window: the cap is a frame rate, 0 for
 *    the display's refresh rate, -1 for every game frame.
 * 3. Display vsync (backend). A blocking vsync present can only pace the game
 *    while game frames come no faster than the display refreshes; above that
 *    the backend presents without blocking and the cap alone limits presents.
