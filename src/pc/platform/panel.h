/* The Mods and Controls windows drawn inside the game's window, for a
 * platform that cannot open a second window (Android; MEMORIES_PANELS=overlay
 * shows them so on a desktop, for testing). One module draws and handles
 * each (mods_window.c, controls_window.c), as in its own window; this is the
 * other host. The panel covers the whole window, opaque, its contents kept
 * inside the safe area (clear of a phone's cutouts) and the rest filled. It
 * has the pointer, the keys and typed text while it shows.
 *
 * A finger is not a mouse: a press is held until it is known to be a tap
 * (it lifts where it went down: the module gets the press and the release
 * then) or a drag (it moves 8 dp: what it went down on scrolls, the module's
 * Drag). A press on something that follows the finger (a slider, a
 * scrollbar: the module's Grabs) goes to the module at once, as a mouse's.
 * Pointer and keys come in window pixels; the module sees panel pixels.
 *
 * The backend (sdl.c) feeds it events, draws it into its overlay canvas,
 * pauses the game while it shows (the picture is covered and the game would
 * get no input), steps the touch controls aside and shows the system's
 * on-screen keyboard while a field takes typing (Panel_TextFocus).
 * Platform-independent and display-free (tests/pc/panels_preview.c drives
 * it); main thread only. */
