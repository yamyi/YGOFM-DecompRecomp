/* Android: libmain.so, the library SDL's Java shell loads and whose SDL_main
 * it runs, is only this loader. The game is libgame.so, linked at a fixed
 * base (MEMORIES_ANDROID_GAME_BASE, set by build_game32.py), and loaded here
 * into a range reserved at that very address, so it sits where it was
 * linked on every launch: the addresses a save state holds (return
 * addresses on the game stack, callbacks in guest RAM, the game's variables)
 * and the build's symbol tables (crash reports) mean the same thing from one
 * launch to the next, as they do for the desktop executables. The system
 * would otherwise load it at a different address each time.
 *
 * If the range cannot be had, the 64-bit game is not loaded at all (its
 * function addresses go into 4-byte guest slots: anywhere else it would run
 * broken), and the player is told so in a message box; the 32-bit one is
 * loaded where the system chooses and told so (MEMORIES_ANDROID_LOAD_BIAS):
 * it runs, but its save states cannot be carried to another launch
 * (notes/pc-build.md, "Android"). A failure ends the process: the app does
 * not just flash and close. */
