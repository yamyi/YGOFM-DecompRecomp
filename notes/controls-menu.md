# Controls

On a phone or tablet (Android) this is a panel inside the game's window
(`panel.h`; [Android](pc-build.md#mods-and-controls-as-panels-inside-the-window)):
one page that a drag scrolls, between a fixed header (Keyboard/Controller,
Player 1/2) and a fixed footer (Clear, Rebind, Cancel, Apply, OK over the
message line), with rows and buttons 48 dp tall. Tap a binding, then Rebind,
and press the key or the controller's button; a second tap on a binding also
starts listening. Back is Escape. Everything below holds there too.

Open **Game > Controls...**. The header holds the window title, the Player 1 /
Player 2 segmented control, the Keyboard and Controller tabs and an "Unsaved
changes" marker. Below it the Controller row holds the device list and a state
badge (Connected, Not connected, Switched off, or "Choose again after a
restart" for two identical pads). Choose Player 1 or Player 2, then choose an
actual controller from that list. Automatic fills free ports while preserving
connected assignments; None disables that port's controller. Keyboard and mouse
continue to belong to Player 1. A connected third controller can be selected.

Double-click a binding cell or a PS1 diagram button to start the 10-second rebind timer.
You can also select a binding cell and choose Rebind (or press Enter). Release held inputs,
then press the new key, controller button, D-pad direction, trigger or stick
direction. Escape cancels; capture also cancels on focus loss, disconnection or
a ten-second timeout. Repeated keyboard events do not create bindings. Esc,
F10 and modifier chords are reserved. Right Shift alone remains
available for Select. If the input belongs to another action (a pad button
or a Game list row, such as F5 for Save state), choose Move binding
or Cancel. Clear unbinds the selected slot. Controller rows have two slots so
D-pad and stick directions can both control the same PS1 direction.

Both tabs show the PlayStation pad picture beside the binding table. The
picture always shows a PS1 controller using the supplied cyan outline artwork
on a transparent background, regardless of the connected hardware; its buttons
highlight the mapped PlayStation output, and the panel header names whatever is
held. Clicking a button in the picture selects that PS1 action, and
double-clicking it starts a rebind. The selected button wears a
three-pixel grey-green ring drawn over the artwork; pressed buttons are filled
green underneath it so the outlines stay readable. Each button has two rectangles, both derived from
ps1-controller.png: the drawn button, which is what the ring encloses and a
press fills, and a larger mouse target. The targets tile the picture and never
overlap - the D-pad and the face cluster are split four ways along the lines
between their buttons, the shoulders split just under the L2/R2 strip, and
Select/Start take the space around them - so a click always means one button
even though the drawn buttons (the D-pad arrows, the few-pixel L2/R2 strips)
are small. The window test checks that the targets stay disjoint and that a
click on any drawn button selects it. Stick clicks (L3/R3) have no place on the
artwork and are edited in the list. The Controller dropdown lists the actual
connected PC controllers by name; it chooses the input device, not a diagram
style.

The table lists the 16 destinations in reading order under group headings
(D-pad, Face buttons, Shoulders and triggers, Stick clicks, System), with
column headings above them; the keyboard tab has one binding column, the
controller tab a main and an alternate column. That order is presentation only:
the stored file, the destination indices and the wire bits keep the order of
`Controls_Actions`.

### The Game list

The port's own actions are a second list, **Game**, under the pad picture
(under the pad list when the window is too small for the picture), with the
same columns: Exit game, Fullscreen, Screenshot, Mute, Volume up and down
(Program); Save state, Load state, State slot 1 to 4 (Save states); Pause,
Frame step and Turbo (Speed); Debug HUD and Deck slots (Tools). They
default to the keys the port always had (Esc, F11, F12, M, keypad + and -,
F5, F7, F1, F2, none, F4, P, `.`, Tab, F3, F6) and to nothing on
controllers, where either slot takes any button, trigger, stick or D-pad
direction. They are kept out of the pad bits the game reads
(`Controls_HostActions`, rows 16 onward, `CTRL_ROW_*`), and the menus show
the keys bound now. A source still belongs to one row per profile, pad and
Game alike, so moving X to Exit game takes it off Cross and moving F5 to
Cross leaves Save state unbound. Most fire once per press; Turbo lasts
while held and the volume repeats while held (`host_actions.c`). The
arrows stay in the list that has the selection; Tab moves between the two,
and the wheel scrolls the one under the pointer.

Exit game quits, as File > Exit does, asking first while **File > Confirm
before quitting** is on (`quit_prompt.c`). Esc is always Exit game in a
window, whatever the row holds: it is reserved everywhere else, and in this
window it cancels a capture, so it cannot be pressed in, but clearing or
replacing the row only adds or drops the other key, never Esc's way out.
The window says so when the slot is cleared, while the row is selected and
while it listens for that row.

Below the Game list, **Fixed keys** lists for reference what no binding
changes: F10 opens the menu bar, Alt+Enter switches fullscreen, Shift with
the Screenshot key saves the whole window, and Esc leaves fullscreen and
closes menus, dialogs and this window. It is text only and drops out first
when the window is short. Below the table the selected binding is named in full, with
Clear and Rebind beside it, then a hint line (or the capture countdown) and the
message line.

The window is resizable, with a minimum size of 560x440. As it shrinks, the
table scrolls, then the pad picture drops out, and under 560 logical rows of
height the hint line goes too (the capture countdown moves to the message line); the menu scale drops towards 1 rather than clipping the
layout. Tab/Shift+Tab move focus, arrows navigate rows and lists, Enter
activates, Delete clears the focused slot, and Page Up/Page Down scroll.
The pointer highlights whatever it is over. Menu navigation uses mouse and
keyboard only. Controller inputs are used for binding capture and live previews;
they cannot move focus, activate menu buttons or close the window.

Apply saves and activates the draft. OK also closes. Cancel discards changes
since the last Apply. Closing a dirty window offers Apply, Discard and Keep
editing. Restore keyboard/controller defaults changes only the current
tab/profile after confirmation. Apply carries an accent outline while the draft differs
from the saved configuration and drops to a flat, disabled face when there is
nothing to save (the same disabled face Clear uses on an empty slot), and
the dialogs (unsaved changes, restore defaults, input already in use) dim the
window behind them. A save failure leaves both the active mapping and existing file
unchanged. Live gameplay input is suppressed while this window is open, and held
inputs must be released before gameplay resumes. Scripted `MEMORIES_INPUT` still
works. Capture and device discovery work while the game is paused.

Explicit device selections remain disconnected if the selected device is absent;
they do not silently take another controller. Stable Linux device identities use
vendor/product/bus plus serial or physical path. SDL and evdev share these
identities where SDL supplies an accessible evdev path. Devices without a stable
identity can be selected for the current session; the UI warns that selection
must be repeated after restart. Transport or USB-port changes can also require
reselection. Previous profiles remain in the file. Discovery supports 32 devices
and storage supports 16 device profiles. Physical hardware/driver-specific naming
and reconnect behavior should still be checked with the user's controllers.

## Controller compatibility

The default SDL3 backend is shared by Linux and Windows. It uses SDL's mappings
for Xbox, PlayStation, Switch Pro/Joy-Con and generic gamepads. Face bindings are
positional: the bottom button defaults to PS1 Cross. The window labels this A on
Xbox, Cross on PlayStation and B on Switch; unknown families keep South/East/West/North.
These display labels do not change saved binding tokens or the PS1 diagram.

Touchpad clicks, four rear paddles and SDL's six miscellaneous buttons can be
rebound when the device/driver exposes them independently. Touch gestures, motion
sensors, rumble and adaptive-trigger effects are not implemented. Digital triggers
and hat D-pads are handled by SDL's mapping layer as well as analog triggers.

For a pad SDL does not recognize, provide a mapping for that device and platform
using `SDL_GAMECONTROLLERCONFIG_FILE` before starting the game
([SDL documentation](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_HINT_GAMECONTROLLERCONFIG_FILE)).
The Controls window edits recognized gamepad inputs; it does not create raw
joystick mappings. USB and Bluetooth may require different mapping entries.

The optional Linux X11/evdev backend uses kernel button/axis conventions rather
than SDL's device database. It accepts analog Z/RZ triggers, with HAT2Y/HAT2X as
fallbacks per the [kernel gamepad specification](https://kernel.org/doc/html/latest/input/gamepad.html),
and digital TL2/TR2. Use the default SDL backend for controllers needing device
mapping quirks or the extra buttons above.

Compatibility regression checks (after building the platform dependencies):

```sh
python3 tools/pc/test_controls_backend.py --target linux
python3 tools/pc/test_controls_backend.py --target windows --software
```

The Windows command runs natively on Windows or through Wine on Linux. Omit
`--software` where OpenGL is available to include context-ownership checks.
The fixtures exercise PS5, Switch Pro, Xbox One and generic mappings with
nonstandard raw button order, digital/analog triggers, hats, extra buttons,
rebinding/applying, removal, input gating and window resizing. They are virtual
devices, not certification of physical USB/Bluetooth or native Windows drivers.
Linux OpenGL and Windows/Wine software rendering were checked for this change;
Wine OpenGL was unavailable on the test host (no matching GL pixel format).

## Storage

Controls live outside guest saves and save states. The default file is
`controls.txt` in the user directory (`src/pc/platform/paths.h`).
`MEMORIES_CONTROLS` overrides it; otherwise an explicit `MEMORIES_SETTINGS`
places `controls.txt` beside that settings file. Apply writes a temporary
file in the same directory, checks flush/close and atomically renames it. Missing files use defaults. Invalid files fall back to defaults
with a diagnostic. Unsupported versions are preserved and cannot be overwritten
by Apply: a release from before version 2 plays with default controls beside a
version 2 file and leaves it as it is.

Version 2 is ASCII with newline-terminated records:

```text
controls 2 <device-profile-count>
port <0|1> <mode> <icon-style> <hex-identity-or-dash>
device <profile-index> <icon-style> <hex-identity>
bind <map-index> <slot-index> <source-token>
host <map-index> <action-token> <slot> <source-token>
```

Both port records are required. Mode 0 means None, 1 Automatic, 2 explicit.
The legacy icon-style field (0–4) is retained for file compatibility and ignored
by the fixed PS1 diagram. Identities
are hex-encoded bytes; `-` is the empty identity. Profile indices start at zero.
Map 0 is the keyboard, maps 1 and 2 are per-port controller defaults, and maps
3 onward are stored device profiles. Each map has exactly 32 binding records:
slot index = PS1 bit index × 2 + binding slot, and a host record per Game list
action and binding slot, named by the action's token (`host 0 exit 0 key.esc`
is the default Exit game, `host 1 save_state 1 button.guide` a controller's
alternate Save state). Host records are optional: a missing one is its
default, left unbound when the file gave that key to another row, and a token
this build does not know (a later build's action) is skipped. The keyboard's
second slots are always `unbound`. `key.esc` is valid only as the keyboard's
Exit game. Version 1 is the same without host records; it still loads, with
the Game list at its defaults, and the next Apply writes version 2. An entire default file is produced by Apply; the example above
is a grammar, not a complete usable configuration.

Source examples: `key.x`, `key.rshift`, `button.south`, `button.l-shoulder`,
`axis.l-stick_y_-`, `axis.r-stick_x_+`, `trigger.r-trigger`, `hat.dpad_up`,
`unbound`. Tokens use canonical physical names, independently of the current
keyboard layout's display labels. No SDL enum values, X keycodes or event-node
numbers are persisted. Duplicate records/sources, invalid ranges, missing records,
excessive lines and long identities are rejected. The existing default mapping
is listed in [pc-build.md](pc-build.md).

## Implementation and verification

The window redesign of 2026-09-21 kept every rule above and changed the
presentation: the menu.c palette so the game menu, Mods and Controls match,
grouped table rows with column headings, tabs and a segmented player control,
pointer highlighting, a device state badge, a capture countdown, dimmed
dialogs, and Delete/Page Up/Page Down. `ControlsWindow_MinSize` feeds the
backends' minimum window size, and `ControlsWindow_Locate` returns where the
last draw put a widget, so tests address controls by the
`CONTROLS_UI_*` ids in `controls_window.h` instead of by pixel. Both backends
create the window resizable (SDL `SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE` plus
`SDL_SetWindowMinimumSize`; X11 `PMinSize` with `StructureNotifyMask`) and
rebuild the canvas and texture/XImage on resize, keeping the old pair when the
new one cannot be made.

Shared modules are `controls` (mapping/capture), `controls_config` (persistence),
`controls_runtime` (device registry, assignments, published input),
`controls_window` (drawing and interaction), and `controls_linux` (Linux device
identity). SDL and X11 own their native windows and normalize input into the
shared types. Gamepad/keyboard getters read cached words; mapping, I/O, allocation
and UI work run on the main thread. Secondary SDL renderers restore the game GL
context before returning. The controller PNG is embedded in the executable and
alpha-blended by `controls_art`; see [artwork and edit prompt](../src/pc/assets/README.md).
The artwork has no analog sticks, so L3/R3 are edited in the binding list.

The initial partial implementation had out-of-bounds axis/trigger indexing, a
button mask too narrow for its enum, colliding source identities, and incomplete
neutral capture. These were corrected before backend integration.

Validation on 2026-09-21 (re-run after the window redesign):

- `tmp/pc-controls`: all 13 CTests passed, including mapping, config, runtime,
  window, evdev, existing settings/Mods, and portable game core tests.
- `tmp/pc-controls-sanitize`: the five controls CTests passed with AddressSanitizer
  and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.
- Native 32-bit SDL (`./build-pc.sh`) and X11 (`--backend x11`) builds succeeded.
- `tools/pc/test_controls_backend.sh` passed using real SDL3 virtual controllers
  and the offscreen OpenGL driver: three devices, explicit third-device selection,
  buttons/sticks/triggers, removal, suppression/release gating, actual secondary
  window event dispatch/rebinding, and repeated Controls/Mods GL context checks.
- `tools/pc/test_mods_context.sh` passed.
- Native SDL headless screenshot smoke fixtures (main-menu cursor, options and
  title) matched their existing hashes; fixture hashes were not changed.
- `tools/pc/preview_controls.sh` renders review images under `tmp/pc/controls-*.ppm`
  using the actual menu text renderer: keyboard and controller tabs, the device
  list, capture, both dialogs, a disconnected controller, the minimum window
  size, menu scale 2 and the bitmap fallback font. It drives the window through
  its own key API, so the pictures survive layout changes. All were inspected.
- The window CTest also covers reading-order navigation, Delete, pointer
  highlighting, wheel clamping and the minimum-size layout; the SDL backend test
  covers a resize down to the minimum size.

The evdev test uses synthetic reads/ioctls, including `SYN_DROPPED`, range
normalization, paused polling and EOF removal. No physical controller was used
for this change. X11 native compilation and its shared UI/evdev tests are covered;
interactive X11 window-manager behavior remains a manual check.

Re-run the five controls tests with:

```sh
cmake -S . -B tmp/pc-controls -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build tmp/pc-controls
ctest --test-dir tmp/pc-controls --output-on-failure -R '^pc_controls'
tools/pc/test_controls_backend.sh
tools/pc/preview_controls.sh
```
