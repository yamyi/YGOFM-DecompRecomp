/* Confirm Menu Circle Exit.
 *
 * Circle on the mode-select wheel (CAMPAIGN / FREE DUEL / BUILD DECK /
 * LIBRARY / PASSWORD / SAVE) drops straight to the title menu, so one stray
 * press loses the player's place. This raises a yes/no prompt instead.
 * Cross confirms, Circle cancels, Left/Right choose, NO is the default.
 *
 * Ported from YuGiOhForbiddenMemoriesRecomp, feature/disable-menu-back-fm,
 * src/psx_mode_select_confirm.c. That port is a static recompilation and works
 * from outside the game: it pokes guest RAM by address, hooks the routine that
 * fills the BIOS pad buffer, and steers the leave after the fact. Here the
 * same bytes have names and the functions that read them can be hooked
 * directly, so most of that machinery has nothing to do.
 *
 *   0x80184594 -> gMain_bMenuID      the highlighted row, and the destination
 *                                    a leave carries (MainMenuSelection)
 *   0x80184595 -> D_80184595         the leave-requested flag
 *   0x800EF66A -> gInput_wPad1Pressed and its Held/Repeat twins, already
 *                                    derived, active high, byte order sorted
 *
 * HOW THE LEAVE IS CANCELLED
 *
 * MainMenu_UpdateFrontendMenu's tail reads the pad. Circle on a row >= 5 plays
 * SE 8, sets D_80184595 and falls into MainMenu_StartFrontendEntryTransition(1).
 * A later call sees the transition running, finds the flag set with the row
 * still >= 5, and rewrites gMain_bMenuID to 1 (LOAD) -- which builds the title
 * screen.
 *
 * So the hook is the transition, not the pad. Mode 1 with the flag already set
 * and the wheel on a mode-select row IS the leave, at the one instant it
 * starts and before any state has moved. Refusing to call the original and
 * clearing the flag cancels it outright: no transition begins, nothing to snap
 * back from, and the wheel is left exactly where it stood.
 *
 * Two of upstream's load-bearing rules are then absent: it must never clear
 * held state (the repeat engine derives new-press from it), and it must eat
 * Circle while the prompt is up -- both because it edits the pad upstream of
 * that engine. We mask the derived words around one call to one consumer and
 * put them back immediately, so the engine's own history never sees an edit.
 * Its bounded 90-frame YES drive is not needed either: on YES we do what the
 * stock branch does, in its order.
 *
 * Its release latch we do need, for a reason of our own. Input_UpdatePads
 * stashes a press in gInput_dwDeferredPressed whenever the vblank counter it
 * tests has run past 0, and replays it on a later frame. The frame that opens
 * the prompt reads the disc and uploads a sheet, so it overruns by definition
 * and the opening Circle arrives a second time. The latch swallows that, and
 * holds the answer again while the port's menu bar has the input.
 *
 * HOW IT IS DRAWN
 *
 * By the game, with the game's own font. Established by measurement against
 * two VRAM captures (the wheel and the password screen), cross-checked with
 * notes/boot-frontend-sequence.md and upstream's tools/font_extract.py:
 *
 *   - the charset is 4bpp at VRAM word (640,0), texel (2560,0): texture page
 *     10, and the page's first 128 texels by 72 rows;
 *   - 96 cells, 16 per row, each glyph 8 wide and 12 tall, pitch 8 and 12;
 *   - ASCII 0x21..0x5A are cells 0..57, six non-ASCII symbols follow, and
 *     0x60..0x7F resume at cell 64. Space is an advance, not a cell;
 *   - the 4-bit value is a brightness ramp, not a palette index: 0 is
 *     transparent, 1 the dark outline the game draws round every glyph, the
 *     high values the core. The tint therefore comes from which ramp the CLUT
 *     points at -- the eight rows at VRAM (640,232), which boot stage 2 loads
 *     and which are the game's own text colours;
 *   - the block is byte-identical in both captures, so it is resident here.
 *
 * The frame art is loaded once from the disc and uploaded when opened.
 * GsSortPoly copies a
 * primitive into its own packet buffer before linking it (src/pc/sdk/libgs.c),
 * so the primitives below can be locals and need no guest-addressable arena.
 *
 * The one thing not measured is the ordering-table priority, which decides
 * whether the panel lands in front of the wheel. It is a setting.
