/* The 3D Monsters mod (mod.json beside this file; notes/modding.md): the
 * face-up monsters on the duel field stand on their
 * cards as the models the battle presentation uses, animating on the spot,
 * floating just above them, the player's turned to face the opponent and the
 * opponent's to face the player, whichever way the camera is round. When one
 * monster attacks another, the two also stand on the big cards of the battle
 * presentation, turned towards each other (draw_battle).
 *
 * The console could not do this: one monster's MODEL.MRG record is a quarter
 * of its RAM and a quarter of its VRAM, and the duel already has both. The
 * port has neither limit, so each monster gets a private arena (mapped
 * outside guest RAM, at a negative address so the pointer-sign idioms in the
 * model code still hold) and a private texture bank in the software GPU
 * (src/pc/render/soft_gpu.h), which is VRAM-shaped memory a primitive selects
 * with bits the hardware leaves unused in its texture-page word.
 *
 * The monsters are sorted into the game's own model ordering table, the one
 * the battle presentation draws its two duellists into, so they are layered
 * where the game would layer them: over the field, under the hand and the
 * rest of the interface, and against each other by depth.
 *
 * Everything the game owns is borrowed and returned inside the pass: model
 * slot 0 (the duel field itself only uses slot 2, the arena), the packet work
 * base and, while a monster is being loaded, the loader's staging buffer and
 * the model area of VRAM. With the mod off nothing here runs at all.
 *
 * How a monster is loaded, all of it synchronous and beside the game's
 * streaming (Memories_DiscReadSectors), so the duel's own transfers are not
 * disturbed:
 *
 * - `Model_LoadMonsterMerge`'s id arithmetic picks the MODEL.MRG record;
 * - the record's seventeen phases are what `func_80056D7C` programs, so its
 *   copies are replayed here against this monster's arena instead of the two
 *   fixed duel arenas. The phases that a slot flagged `0x80` skips (the
 *   sequence bank and the 50-sector block) are skipped here too;
 * - the phases that upload to VRAM upload for real, because the palette phase
 *   of the setup below reads them back through the GPU. The duel's pixels are
 *   put back afterwards and the monster's block is kept in its bank;
 * - `func_80056828` then runs the same eleven setup phases the game runs,
 *   including `func_8004CB0C`'s parse of the HMD data in the arena. With the
 *   three command words at -1 (which the `0x80` flag leaves behind) no
 *   per-monster control module is ever called, so none is loaded.
 *
 * Drawing is `func_800540B4` and `func_800556E8`, the pair the Library's card
 * model view already drives, with the slot placed by `func_8005A4C4` at the
 * card's own field coordinates (`D_800908A0`, the table the duel projects its
 * card sprites from).
