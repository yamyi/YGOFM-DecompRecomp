/* The 3D Monsters mod's "Card art" style (mod.json beside this file, the
 * "style" setting; notes/modding.md): where the "3D models" style stands a
 * battle model on a face-up field card, this stands an enlarged cutout of
 * the card's own art instead, floating just above it, always facing the
 * camera. No model, no arena, no VRAM budget to borrow: a card's art record
 * is seven sectors of WA_MRG.MRG, the same disc data the card-detail panel
 * and the Library already draw large, held here one bank per cached card in
 * the software GPU (src/pc/render/soft_gpu.h), exactly as field_models.c
 * holds a model's textures. field_models.c's own draw_frame calls
 * FieldArt_DrawFrame (below) instead of drawing a model, when the style
 * setting says to; this file has no MemoriesModInit of its own.
 *
 * Unlike a model, a cutout has no size of its own to measure: every card's
 * art is the same 102x96 record, so one world-space height serves every
 * zone, and perspective alone makes a farther card's cutout smaller -- the
 * fitting loop below (fit_height) finds that height once a frame, the same
 * way the 3D Monsters mod's fit() finds a model's scale, but by projecting
 * two points instead of measuring drawn packets.
 *
 * Drawing is a single POLY_FT4 per face-up monster, its four corners placed
 * in screen space from two world points (the card's own field position, and
 * that position lifted by the fitted height) run through RotTransPers under
 * the frame's own world-screen matrix (D_800FE148, GsSetRefView2's own),
 * exactly as func_80015EF4 projects a field card's ground sprite. The same
 * call's returned depth is at RotTransPers' own native resolution, a quarter
 * as fine as the card scale func_80015EF4 sorts a field card's own upright
 * quad at (its own comment on a model's primitives); draw_one() divides it
 * down the same single step the 3D Monsters mod's sort_monster does
 * (`nearest / 4`) before it sorts the cutout into D_800E9D90[2] -- the same
 * table func_80015EF4 sorts that upright quad into, and the one the 3D
 * Monsters mod's own field-standing draw_monster() uses too (as
 * D_800E9D98[0], its own comment's name for the same table): shared with the
 * field's own card geometry, not borrowed for being unused, so a cutout
 * sorts correctly against the card it stands on and against other cutouts. */

 * glow). A bank of its own past the per-card cache (CACHE banks 1..CACHE,
 * so GLOW_BANK is always free) holds one square texture, GLOW_SIZE across,
 * generated once: at each texel, in coordinates normalised to [-1, 1]
 * across the texture, INNER_HALF is the half-width of a middle square left
 * untouched (it sits under the cutout itself, which draws over it, so its
 * exact brightness there does not matter); outside it, the texel's index is
 * the Euclidean distance to the middle square's nearest edge or corner,
 * scaled so it reaches 0 -- fully transparent, the same hardware rule as
 * the earlier attempts relied on -- at the texture's own edge along x or y,
 * and clamps there before the actual corners, which is what rounds them off
 * rather than squaring them like the first attempt's strips did. A
 * 256-entry CLUT turns every other index into that much white, STP set
 * (BGR555's bit 15, the semi-transparency flag the renderer reads alongside
 * the primitive's own setSemiTrans -- both must be on, or it draws opaque,
 * gl_picture.c). The glow's own colour is entirely the primitive's
 * r0/g0/b0 modulation (settings glow_r/g/b), scaled each frame by a sine
 * wave (glow_period, frames per full pulse) between a floor and full
 * brightness -- never down to fully off, which is what read as "on/off"
 * rather than a breathing pulse -- for the "shining" look; abr 1 (GetTPage's
 * second argument) is the additive blend equation, so the glow brightens
 * whatever is under it instead of covering it. One quad, its middle square
 * scaled to match the cutout's own rectangle exactly (so the diffusing part
 * sits outside it) and its overall size then scaled again by glow_reach, at
