/* The Hand camera mod (mod.json beside this file; notes/modding.md): while
 * the hand is up (scene state 4, the human's hand
 * actions), where the console leaves the shoulder buttons unused, L1 and R1
 * turn the duel camera around the mat and L3 and R3 zoom it (L2 and R2 are
 * the game's own top-down look at the opponent's field). Both move the
 * view state's own numbers (D_800F2848: angle, a 0x1000-unit turn, and
 * field_00, the distance) and re-apply ViewState_ApplyOrbit, which the game
 * itself only does while one of its own camera tweens runs; the mat, the
 * card sprites and the 3D Monsters mod all follow.
 *
 * The view stays where it was put. Nothing eases it back on release, and
 * nothing resets it when the hand closes: every camera move the game makes
 * from there (placing a card, the turn switch, an attack) is a tween from
 * the current view to an absolute target, so the game's own moves carry the
 * camera back to its usual places smoothly. */
